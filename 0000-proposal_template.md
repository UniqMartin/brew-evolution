# $FEATURE_NAME
## Introduction
A short, single-paragraph "elevator pitch" describing what the feature is.

## Motivation
Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is
that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show how one can
currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks. If it's completely
new functionality that cannot be emulated, explain why this new functionality
would help Homebrew users.

## Proposed solution
Describe a solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they
work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner,
safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design
Describe the design of the solution in detail. The detail in this section
should be sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors of this
proposal to be able to reasonably implement the feature.

## Alternatives considered
Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem and why you
chose this approach instead.
